# Transformational Reconstruction By Shingo Sato: A Review of the Book and Its Applications to Numismatici Storyboa
 
Transformational Reconstruction (TR) is a design technique developed by Shingo Sato, a couture designer who designs for private clients and teaches in both Milan and Tokyo. TR involves creating complex and innovative shapes by manipulating patterns on a flat surface, without using darts or seams. The technique is explained and illustrated in Sato's book, *Transformational Reconstruction*, published by Center for Pattern Design in 2011.

In this article, we will review the book and its contents, as well as explore how TR can be applied to numismatici storyboa, a form of storytelling that uses coins as visual elements. Numismatici storyboa is a creative way to express ideas and narratives using the rich symbolism and history of coins from different cultures and eras.
 
The book *Transformational Reconstruction* consists of 112 pages, divided into four chapters: Basic TR, Advanced TR, TR with Draping, and TR with Origami. Each chapter presents a series of exercises that demonstrate how to create various shapes and forms using TR techniques. The exercises are accompanied by detailed photographs and descriptions that guide the reader through the process. The book also includes an introduction by Sandra Ericson, the editor and founder of Center for Pattern Design, who explains the background and philosophy of TR.
 
The book is intended for intermediate to advanced level designers who have some experience with pattern making and sewing. The book does not provide basic instructions on how to draft patterns or construct garments, but rather focuses on how to transform existing patterns into new designs using TR. The book also assumes that the reader has access to a dress form or a mannequin to test and adjust the patterns.
 
The book is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about TR and expand their design repertoire. The book showcases Sato's creativity and mastery of the technique, as well as his ability to teach and inspire others. The book is also a testament to the versatility and potential of TR, as it shows how it can be applied to different fabrics, styles, and garments.
 
One of the possible applications of TR is numismatici storyboa, which is a term coined by us to describe a form of storytelling that uses coins as visual elements. Coins are not only currency, but also artifacts that reflect the culture, history, and values of their issuers. Coins can be used to tell stories about people, places, events, concepts, or emotions. For example, one can use coins to create a storyboa about ancient Rome, medieval Europe, colonial America, or modern Australia.
 
To create a numismatici storyboa using TR, one can follow these steps:
 
1. Select a theme or a topic for the storyboa.
2. Research and collect coins that are relevant to the theme or topic. For example, if the theme is ancient Rome, one can collect coins from different periods of Roman history, such as the Republic, the Empire, or the Byzantine era.
3. Analyze the coins and identify their features, such as images, symbols, inscriptions, colors, shapes, sizes, materials, etc.
4. Choose a fabric that matches or contrasts with the coins. For example, if the coins are silver or gold, one can choose a fabric that is black or white.
5. Create a pattern for a garment or an accessory that incorporates the coins as design elements. For example, one can create a pattern for a dress that has coin-shaped cutouts on the bodice or hem.
6. Use TR techniques to transform the pattern into a more complex and interesting shape. For example, one can use origami folds to create pleats or ruffles on the fabric.
7. Sew the garment or accessory using the pattern and fabric. Attach the coins to the fabric using stitches or glue.
8. Display the garment or accessory on a dress form or a mannequin. Arrange the coins in a way that creates a visual narrative or message.

A numismatici storyboa using TR can be a fun and creative way to express oneself using coins and fabric. It can also be a way to learn more about history and culture through coins. A numismatic
